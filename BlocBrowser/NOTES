UIWebView

-a UIView subclass designed to display web content, including HTML, CSS and JS
It can also display email attachments like PDFs and MS Word docs.

Some methods and properties we need for our browser:

-the loadRequest: method tells the web view to begin loading content
-the stopLoading method tells the web view to stop loading
-the reload method tells the webv view to reload the current content
-the loading property tells you if the web view is currently loading
-the goBack and goForward methods can be used as button actions to move through web history

Requesting web sites: NSURLRequest and NSURL

We need to tell our UIWebView instance which site to load.
To do this, we'll need to construct an NSURLRequest objce

NSURLRequest objects represent a request to load a URL
Most common URLs look like http://www.bloc.io, but this object can be used
to represent other protocols (like FTP) or other schemes (like file:// or news://)

NSString *blocURLString = @"http://bloc.io";
NSURL *blocURL = [NSURL URLWithString:blocURLString];
NSURLRequest *blocURLRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:blocURL];
